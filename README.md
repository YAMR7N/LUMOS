# EJUST Study Assistant - Proof of Concept

A simple working prototype that transforms uploaded notes into a chat-enabled knowledge base with figure regeneration.

## What It Does

1. **Upload** - Drag & drop PDFs or images
2. **Chat** - Ask questions about your notes
3. **Regenerate** - Create clean versions of diagrams
4. **Export** - Download improved notes
